# Dog doodle images

Add dog illustration images here so the app can show them on the Home and Dashboard pages. Use **external sources** (do not use hand-drawn custom art).

## Expected files

Place these files in this folder (`public/doodles/`):

| Filename       | Used for              | Suggested size |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------|
| `dog-main.png` or `dog-main.svg` | Hero card & dashboard (main dog) | ~200–400px |
| `dog-peek.png` or `dog-peek.svg`  | Small “peeking” dog in corners   | ~80–120px  |
| `dog-buddies.png` or `dog-buddies.svg` | Two dogs / “buddies” on Why card | ~150–250px |

The app looks for `.png` first, then `.svg`. You can use either format.

## Where to get images

- **unDraw** (free, no attribution): https://undraw.co/illustrations — search “dog” (e.g. “Good doggy”) and download SVG or PNG.
- **Noun Project** (free with attribution or paid): https://thenounproject.com/browse/icons/term/dog-doodle/ — many simple dog doodle icons in SVG/PNG.
- **Public Domain Vectors**: https://publicdomainvectors.org — filter by “dog” and “SVG” for public domain cartoon dogs.
- **Adobe Stock** (licensed): If you have a subscription, search “dog doodle” or “cartoon dog” and download; then save here with the filenames above.

Use the style you like (e.g. simple line-art doodles like the Adobe Stock examples). Replace these placeholder files anytime with new downloads.
