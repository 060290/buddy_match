# Git: commit and push after every change

After making any code changes, always end by generating the exact terminal commands to commit and push to GitHub.

**Always provide this block:**

```bash
cd /Users/ellie/Desktop/buddy_match
git add -A
git commit -m "Short descriptive message"
git push origin main
```

- Use a concise, imperative commit message (e.g. "Fix dashboard map", "Add location search").
- If the branch is not `main`, use the correct branch name for `git push`.
- If there is no remote, give only `git add` and `git commit` and note how to add remote and push.
