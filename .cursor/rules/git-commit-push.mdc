# Git: commit and push after every change

**You MUST always** end every response that involves code or file changes by giving the user the exact terminal commands to commit and push to GitHub. Do this every time, without exception, even if the user does not ask.

**Always provide this block at the end of your response:**

```bash
cd /Users/ellie/Desktop/buddy_match
git add -A
git commit -m "Short descriptive message"
git push origin main
```

- Use a concise, imperative commit message (e.g. "Fix dashboard map", "Add location search").
- If the branch is not `main`, use the correct branch name for `git push`.
- If there is no remote, give only `git add` and `git commit` and note how to add remote and push.
